## C# What's new and cool

30.5.2023, 10:45 - 11:45, Famosa

C# 11 and .NET 7 are released. What are the newest features of C# and how are they used in .NET applications? In this session you learn about new features such as generic math support, raw string literals, the new `LibraryImport` attribute, and more.

## Finding issues with your .NET applications â€“ monitoring and logging

30.5.2023, 14:00 - 15:00, Allegra

Creating Microservices it's important to know how the application is running - monitoring logs, telemetry, and metrics data. In this session you learn about implementing this functionality with .NET applications, monitoring it with Microsoft Azure services, and enhancements with OpenTelemetry.

## Minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core

31.5.2023, 13:45 - 14:45, Grascina Gratiosa

For quite a while, ASP.NET Core MVC was the only choice when writing REST APIs with ASP.NET Core. It is still a good and valid choice, especially for more complex REST APIs. However, we now have a new way of defining web APIs, for simpler REST APIs, microservice-oriented projects, and simple web apps. Minimal APIs come without the overhead and kitchen-sink approach of MVC. We'll look into the supported features, how they compare with MVC, how Minimal APIs can be extended with libraries like Carter, and what the future brings for Minimal APIs.

## Creating and running .NET services with Azure Container Apps

31.5.2023, 16:30 - 17:30, Thais

Azure Container Apps are a cheap and serverless alternative to Azure Kubernetes Services using Azure Kubernetes Services behind the scenes. Without the need to use kubectl and helm, you can use ARM templates and bicep to configure your services running with Docker containers, Ingress controllers, scaling (down to zero) and triggers for different events are available out of the box. In this session you learn about the concepts of this technology, as well as comparison to Azure Kubernetes Services and Azure Functions.
